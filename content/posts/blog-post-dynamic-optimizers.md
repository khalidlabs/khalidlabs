# Dynamic Optimizers for Chemical Process Industry via Direct Data-Driven Synthesis

## Abstract

The chemical process industry (CPI) faces significant challenges in improving sustainability and efficiency while maintaining conservative principles for managing cost, complexity, and uncertainty. This work introduces a data-driven approach to dynamic real-time optimization (D-RTO) that addresses these concerns by directly extracting process optimization policies from historical plant data. Our method constructs a value function to evaluate trajectory quality and employs weighted regression to derive improved policies. When applied to a plant-wide industrial process control problem, the proposed optimizer demonstrates superior performance in adapting to disturbances while maintaining stability and product quality.

## Introduction

The chemical process industry provides the world with essential products fundamental to modern civilization. Food, medicine, energy, and transport are made possible on a grand scale through CPI products. Concurrently, the industry is confronted with significant challenges pertaining to environmental sustainability and the availability of energy and mineral resources. CPI process improvement has immense potential to address these challenges, but to adopt such improvements, they must consider the human factors involved, particularly the inherent resistance to change within industrial settings.

This resistance and risk aversion is often rooted in concerns about the cost, complexity, and uncertainty associated with implementing new technologies or methodologies. Addressing these legitimate concerns requires demonstrating that advancements in process optimization can be achieved through methods that are not only theoretically sound and economically viable but also straightforward to integrate into existing operations.

## Limitations of Current Approaches

Traditional optimization methods in chemical processing face several limitations:

1. **Steady-state optimization methods** are limited in effectiveness for processes with frequent changes due to long transient dynamics
2. **Real-time optimization (RTO)** requires reaching steady-state, leading to infrequent re-optimization and suboptimal performance
3. **Dynamic real-time optimization (D-RTO)** and **economic model predictive control (EMPC)** require detailed dynamic models that are challenging to construct and update

## Our Data-Driven Approach

We introduce an alternative approach motivated by advances in offline dynamic programming algorithms. The key innovations include:

1. Leveraging rich information embedded in operational historical plant data
2. Constructing a value function to evaluate trajectory quality
3. Using weighted regression to derive policies that imitate high-performing operational trajectories

### Mathematical Framework

For a system with output $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$, control input $u_t \in \mathbb{R}^m$, and set point $v_t \in \mathbb{R}^q$, we define:

- A control policy $\mu : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^q \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, determining the control action $u_t = \mu(y_t, v_t)$
- An optimization policy $\pi : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^q$ selecting the set point $v_t = \pi(y_t)$

The objective is to learn the optimization policy $\pi$ that minimizes the expected cumulative cost:

$$\pi = \arg\min_{\pi} \mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t c(y_t, v_t) \right]$$

where $c : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^q \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the stage cost function, and $\gamma \in (0,1]$ is the discount factor.

## Advantages of Our Approach

The advantages of this data-driven approach are multifold:

1. **No Detailed Process Model Required**: It sidesteps the need for constructing a detailed process model and online parameter and state estimation
2. **No Dynamic Simulations**: Eliminates the need for dynamic simulations, minimizing discrepancies when transferring to real-world operations
3. **Tailored to Plant Characteristics**: By training on actual plant data rather than simulations, the policy is inherently tailored to the plant's unique characteristics
4. **Computational Efficiency**: The optimizing policy is derived offline, requiring only policy execution in real time

## Implementation and Results

When applied to a plant-wide industrial process control problem, our direct data-driven D-RTO approach demonstrated:

- Superior performance in adapting to disturbances
- Maintained stability and product quality
- Improved operational efficiency without requiring extensive modeling efforts

## Conclusion

These results challenge conventional assumptions regarding the potential of data-driven optimization in the chemical process industry. Although limitations exist due to the black-box nature of neural networks, this study presents a promising avenue for enhancing operational efficiency in industrial settings. The proposed approach offers a practical solution for process optimization, as it leverages readily available historical data and does not require extensive modeling efforts.

## Future Research Directions

Future work will focus on:

1. Addressing the interpretability of the learned policies
2. Incorporating safety constraints and uncertainty quantification
3. Extending the approach to multi-objective optimization problems
4. Developing methods for online adaptation to changing process conditions

```python
# Example implementation snippet for value function approximation
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

class ValueFunctionApproximator:
    def __init__(self, hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 100), activation='relu'):
        self.model = MLPRegressor(
            hidden_layer_sizes=hidden_layer_sizes,
            activation=activation,
            solver='adam',
            max_iter=1000,
            early_stopping=True
        )
    
    def fit(self, states, returns):
        self.model.fit(states, returns)
        
    def predict(self, states):
        return self.model.predict(states)
        
# Example of policy extraction via weighted regression
class OptimizationPolicy:
    def __init__(self, hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), activation='tanh'):
        self.model = MLPRegressor(
            hidden_layer_sizes=hidden_layer_sizes,
            activation=activation,
            solver='adam',
            max_iter=1000
        )
    
    def fit(self, states, actions, weights):
        # Apply weights to prioritize high-value trajectories
        sample_weight = np.array(weights)
        self.model.fit(states, actions, sample_weight=sample_weight)
        
    def predict(self, state):
        return self.model.predict([state])[0]
```

This approach has significant potential for improving sustainability and efficiency in the chemical process industry, offering a path toward more adaptive and efficient operations without compromising on safety or reliability.
