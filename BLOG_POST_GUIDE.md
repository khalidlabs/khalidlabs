## üîç **Why the First Post Appears Differently**

### **First Post (`project-adaptive-control.md`):**
- ‚úÖ Has `featured: true` - This makes it appear as a featured post
- ‚úÖ Has `imageUrl` - This adds a featured image
- ‚úÖ Has `slug` - Custom URL slug
- ‚úÖ Has `technologies` - Additional metadata

### **Other Two Posts:**
- ‚ùå No `featured: true` - They appear as regular posts
- ‚ùå No `imageUrl` - No featured image
- ‚ùå Different front matter structure

## Ô∏è **How to Fix This**

You have a few options:

### **Option 1: Make all posts consistent (recommended)**
Add the same front matter to all posts:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
date: 2025-XX-XX
draft: false
description: "Your description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
categories: ["category"]
featured: true  # Add this to make them all featured
---
```

### **Option 2: Remove featured status from first post**
Remove `featured: true` from the first post to make them all appear the same.

### **Option 3: Add featured images to all posts**
Add `imageUrl` to the other posts to give them featured images too.

Would you like me to help you standardize the front matter across all your posts?
